				<p>Hello, we are Swift Models, an elite modelling agency based in more than 10 countries. We are currently and only accepting hot people under our support. </p>
				<p>On a more serious note, my name is Franky Ly and I just had the idea to make a website of the photoshoots that my friends and I take. I wanted to showcase them in a more aesthetically pleasing way than Instagram does since they're kind of destroying their UI by the day. Anyways, I hope this site doesn't come off as too narcissistic but it probably is. Hope you enjoy looking at the photoshoots we've done!</p>
