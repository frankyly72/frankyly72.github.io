                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I like that I learned how Ui design functions on a phone screen. I also liked how diverse the design could be. Regardless of its diversity, they all  still hold similar philosophies in design hierarchy. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked all the images that were shown. I think it gave a clear indicator of what UI Design is supposed to look like. I also like that they were gifs so you could see how interactive it is. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I like the cryptocurrency one. I think it displays how cryptocurrency has this rarity in comparison to money which gives it this cooler, mystical look. The add to cart was also cool. I like how the transition was rainbow, foreshadowing how you can choose between what color you want the shoes to be. </p>
