						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how deliberately fonts are designed for their purpose. Like there are specific fonts that attempt to communicate to a specific age demographic which I find interesting. I also think it's interesting that size contributes to how a specific font communicates its purpose. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like that it gave us more font sites to choose from. I also like that it gave us the advice to research the use of a font. I didn't really know that even fonts have a sort of guide on when it's best used. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users.</p>
