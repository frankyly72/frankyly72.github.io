					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> This is instagram: </p>
							<img src = "assets/imgs/before.jpg" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> This is the after result: </p>
							<img src = "assets/imgs/after.jpg" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of Instagram is to give viewers an insight on what someone's life is based on what stories and images they post. The emphasis on the user profile picture as well as the size of the pictures they post emphasize the aspect that Instagram gives insight on the person themself. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I first removed the home tab, because I noticed that the Instagram logo essentially takes you to the same place which simplifies the design. I also added an option to expand the stories to prevent clutter on one's profile. I lastly added an interactions tab that would help people see what of their own content that person has liked and commented on. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
					</ul>
