            Hello, my name is Franky Ly and I really like listening to pop and K-pop!
            My favorite artists include Charli XCX, Rina Sawayama, Dua Lipa, and Addison Rae.
            I also really like doing photoshoots with my friends, and they're on my instagram,
            which I will link below because I'm kind of proud of my feed!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>1. I think one thing that I appreciate that the article brought up was that you should think about why someone would open up the app. I know that the design itself is important to keep someone on the app, but I kind of overlooked how an app should initially attract someone.</li>
            <li>2. My favorite part of the article was that they gave examples of several apps and made us think about the design of their ui. I also liked that they showed the pictures themself as well.</li>
            <li>3. "Next time youâ€™re sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way."</li>
            <li>4. I would give it an 8</li>
        </ul>
